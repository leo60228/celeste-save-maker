Celeste Save Maker (AKA Save File Corruptorâ„¢ (thanks @FlipKING78))
==================
Currently only supports Windows, although there are prompts that relate to macOS in the program.

Install instructions:
- Download the repository
- Unzip it wherever you see fit
- Download and install the latest version of Python 3 from http://python.org
- In the installer, make sure to select "Add to PATH" to allow command line access
- Navigate to the unzipped folder, and open "start.bat"
- You're all done! Just open that batch file every time you want to run the program, and it should work fine.

To-dos:
- Allow a way to go back if the user makes a mistake instead of having to start over
- Save file paths so you don't have to type it in every time
- Mod compatibility
- macOS compatibility

Known Issues:
- Doesn't allow access to Journal immediately

v1.1 Changelog:
- Added a batch file for easier access
